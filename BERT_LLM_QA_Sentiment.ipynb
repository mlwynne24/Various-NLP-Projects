    "This notebook is the second of two lab notebooks that you will submit as part of your assessment for the Advanced Data Analytics unit. The notebook contains three required sections plus an optional section:\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Introducing Transformers:** This section introduces the Transformers library from HuggingFace, showing you how to use it to obtain contextualised embeddings from pretrained transformer models.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Question Answering with Pretrained Transformers:** Learn about how to use a pretrained model to perform automatic question answering. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Transformers for Text Classification:** Here we show you how to construct a classifier using Transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **OPTIONAL: More on Transformers:** Some pointers to other materials if you want to learn more about transformers, e.g., if using them in your summer project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example code for all the tasks has been tested on a three-year old MacBook Pro, and the longest training process took under 10 minutes. If you find that the code takes too long to run on your own machine, you can try [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), Amazon Sagemaker Studio, or use lab machines on campus provided by the school. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "These sections will contain tutorial-like instructions, as you have seen in previous text analytics labs. On completing these sections, the intended learning outcomes are that you will be able to...\n",
    "1. Use pretrained transformers to obtain contextualised word and sentence embeddings.\n",
    "1. Apply a pretrained QA model to a new dataset. \n",
    "1. Construct classifiers with pretrained transformers. \n",
    "1. Find documentation on pretrained models in the Transformers library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside each of these sections there are several **'To-do's**, which you must complete for your summative assessment. Your marks will be based on your answers to these to-dos. Please make sure to:\n",
    "1. Include the output of your code in the saved notebook. Plots and printed output should be visible without re-running the code. \n",
    "1. Include all code needed to generate your answers.\n",
    "1. Provide sufficient comments to understand how your method works.\n",
    "1. Write text in a cell in markdown format where a written answer is required. You can convert a cell to markdown format by pressing Escape-M. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some unmarked 'to-do's that are part of the tutorial to help you learn how to implement and use the methods studied here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Good Academic Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow [the guidance on academic integrity provided by the university](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/academic-integrity/).\n",
    "You are required to write your own answers -- do not share your notebooks or copy someone else's writing. Do not copy text or long blocks of code directly into the notebook from online sources -- always rewrite in your own way. Breaking the rules can lead to strong penalties. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Marking Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The coursework (both notebooks) is worth 30% of the unit in total. \n",
    "1. There is a total of 100 marks available for both lab notebooks. \n",
    "1. This notebook is worth 50 of those marks.\n",
    "1. The number of marks for each to-do out of 100 is shown alongside each to-do.\n",
    "1. For to-dos that require you to write code, a good solution would meet the following criteria (in order of importance):\n",
    "   1. Solves the task or answers the question asked in the to-do. This means, if the code cells in the notebook are executed in order, we will get the output shown in your notebook.\n",
    "   1. The code is easy to follow and does not contain unnecessary steps.\n",
    "   1. The comments show that you understand how your solution works.\n",
    "   1. A very good answer will also provide code that is computationally efficient but easy to read.\n",
    "1. You can use any suitable publicly available libraries. Unless the task explicitly asks you to implement something from scratch, there is no penalty for using libraries to implement some steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Support\n",
    "\n",
    "The main source of support will be during the remaining lab sessions (Fridays 3-6pm) for this unit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The TAs and lecturer will help you with questions about the lectures, the code provided for you in this notebook, and general questions about the topics we cover. For the marked 'to-dos', they can only answer clarifying questions about what you have to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "Office hours: You can book office hours with Edwin on Mondays 3pm-5pm by sending him an email (edwin.simpson@bristol.ac.uk). If those times are not possible for you, please contact him by email to request an alternative. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Deadline\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook must be submitted along with the second notebook on Blackboard before **Wednesday 24th May at 13.00**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to zip up this notebook with the previous notebook into a single .zip file, which you will submit to Blackboard through the 'assessment, submission and feedback' link on the left sidebar. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please name your files like this:\n",
    "   * Name this notebook ADA2_<student_number>.ipynb\n",
    "   * Name the zip file <student_number>.zip\n",
    "   * Please don't use your name anywhere as we want to mark anonymously. "

    "HuggingFace is a company that has developed an open source library for loading pretrained transformer models. They also distribute many models that have been pretrained using language modelling tasks, or fine-tuned to specific downstream NLP tasks.  It is currently the best library to use to create NLP models on top of large, deep neural networks. This is especially useful for tasks where simpler, feature-based methods or smaller LSTM models do not perform well enough, for example, when complex processing of syntax and semantics is required (natural language 'understanding'). \n",

    "**ANSWER:** The model with fine-tuning performs much better than the model with frozen weights. When reviewing the accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and confusion matrix, it is clear that the frozen model (without fine-tuning) only predicts the majority class, and achieves an F1 score of 0.27. Whereas, the model with fine-tuning achieves an F1 score of 0.78. This is because the model requires fine-tuning to apply BERT effectively to new classification tasks. By using direct transfer learning, rather than inductive transfer learning, the frozen model is only applying knowledge from the basic classification tasks to the problem, rather than learning how to predict sentiment in poems.\n"

    "\n",
    "**ANSWER:** The model with frozen embeddings made use of direct transfer, using knowledge learned from the masked language modelling tasks it was trained on. With a classification head it transfers this knowledge to classfication. However, this knowledge isn't particularly useful on its own for predicting poem sentiment. Therefore, fine-tuning the model uses inductive transfer learning, adapting the model for learning on the poem sentiment classification task. This is beneficial for the task as the inductive bias from previous text understanding is transferred to the task, reducing the necessary training set size needed for effective sentiment classification.\n",
